The `ChannelAdvisor::Services` module directly corresponds to the services and methods in the ChannelAdvisor API. Utilizing this interface ensures consistency with the actual ChannelAdvisor interface and will also allow you to handle errors and response data your own way, i.e. making a minimal amount of assumptions about how to handle the data returned from the web service request. A second, simpler interface is designed for ease-of-use and makes some assumptions about how best to handle the data and errors in the API response. For example, the simple interface would\r\nwork like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nChannelAdvisor::Order.list(:state => \"Active\")\r\n# => [#<ChannelAdvisor::Order>, #<ChannelAdvisor::Order>, ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the `Services` interface would work like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nChannelAdvisor::Services::OrderService.get_order_list(:state => \"Active\")\r\n# => #<Savon::SOAP::Response>\r\n# ... do some neat stuff with the SOAP response\r\n```","google":"UA-42578343-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
